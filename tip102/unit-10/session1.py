Problem 1: Graphing Flights

The following graph represents the different flights offered by CodePath Airlines. 
Each node or vertex represents an airport (JFK - New York City, LAX - Los Angeles, DFW - Dallas Fort Worth, and ATL - Atlanta), 
and an edge between two vertices indicates that CodePath airlines offers flights between those two airports.

Create a variable flights that represents the undirected graph below as an adjacency dictionary, where each node's value is 
represented by a string with the airport's name (ex. "JFK").

"""
JFK ----- LAX
|
|
DFW ----- ATL
"""
# No starter code is provided for this problem
# Add your code here

Example Usage:

print(list(flights.keys()))
print(list(flights.values()))
print(flights["JFK"])

Example Output:

['JFK', 'LAX', 'DFW', 'ATL']
[['LAX', 'DFW'], ['JFK'], ['ATL', 'JFK'], ['DFW']]
['LAX', 'DFW']

'''
flights = {
    'JFK': ["LAX","DFW"],
    'LAX': ["JFK"],
    'DFW': ["JFK", "ATL"],
    'ATL': ["DFW"]
}

'''
Problem 2: There and Back

As a flight coordinator for CodePath airlines, you have a 0-indexed adjacency list flights with n nodes where each node 
represents the ID of a different destination and flights[i] is an integer array indicating that there is a flight from 
destination i to each destination in flights[i]. Write a function bidirectional_flights() that returns True if for any flight 
from a destination i to a destination j there also exists a flight from destination j to destination i. Return False otherwise.



Example Usage:

Example 1: flights1

'flights1' graph diagram

Example 2: flights2 'flights2' graph diagram

Adjacency lists
flights1 = [[1, 2], [0], [0, 3], [2]]
flights2 = [[1, 2], [], [0], [2]]

print(bidirectional_flights(flights1))
print(bidirectional_flights(flights2))

Example Output:

True
False
